API-location-photos
===================

Travelling photo finder is a 12-hour experiment in API usage. Visitors simply enter the name of a location into the search box and hit "search". The Flickr API is then used to identify the searched-for location and return 12 popular photos taken in that area. The Google Maps API is then used to show the location on a map.
